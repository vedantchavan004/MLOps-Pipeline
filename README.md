# MLOps Pipeline for Automated Model Deployment
This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for training and deploying a deep learning model. It includes containerized deployment (Docker), REST API serving (FastAPI), and CI/CD automation.
Key Features
✅ Deep Learning Model: Trained using PyTorch on the MNIST dataset.

✅ Containerized Deployment: Packaged with Docker for easy scalability and portability.

✅ REST API for Model Inference: Built using FastAPI to serve real-time predictions.

✅ CI/CD Automation: GitHub Actions automates testing and deployment.

✅ Docker Hub Integration: Pushes the Docker image for streamlined deployments.
